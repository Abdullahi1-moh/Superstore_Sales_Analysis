# Superstore_Sales_Analysis
Data analysis of Superstore sales using R (dplyr, ggplot2). Includes exploratory data analysis, revenue trends, customer segment analysis, and visualizations.
# ðŸ“Š Superstore Sales Analysis (R)

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from the **Superstore dataset** using R.  
The goal is to identify key business insights including revenue trends, customer segments, and sales performance over time.

## ðŸ”¹ Business Questions Answered
1. What is the **total revenue and total quantity sold**?
2. Which **customer segments** generate the highest revenue?
3. What are the **monthly sales trends** over time?

## ðŸ”¹ Tools & Libraries
- RStudio
- dplyr (data manipulation)
- ggplot2 (visualization)
- readxl / readr (data import)

## ðŸ”¹ Key Insights
- The **Consumer segment** accounts for nearly half of total revenue.
- Sales show consistent **monthly growth** with noticeable seasonal peaks.
- Technology products generate strong sales but profit margins vary.

## ðŸ”¹ Visualizations
- Bar chart: Revenue by Customer Segment
- Line chart: Monthly Sales Trend

## ðŸ”¹ Repository Contents
- `Superstore_sales_Analysis.R` â†’ main R script with analysis and visualizations
- `SUPERSTORE5.xlsx` (or `sales_clean.csv`) â†’ dataset (if shareable)
- `figures/` â†’ saved plots (optional)

## ðŸ”¹ Power BI Dashboard

Alongside the R analysis, I also built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to visualize sales insights.

### Dashboard Highlights
- KPI cards for **Total Revenue (2.3M)** and **Quantity Sold (38K)**
- Year-over-year **Sales & Profit trends**
- **Customer Segment analysis** (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office)
- **Sales by U.S. State** (map visualization)
- **Category & Subcategory breakdown** with quarterly trends
